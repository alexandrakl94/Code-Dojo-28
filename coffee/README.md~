# Three Men's Morris

I've used Node.js and CoffeeScript with the Mocha testing library and the Chai assertion library.

First install the dependencies with:

	npm install

The tests can be run from the command-line with [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/):

	npm test

You can also use this with the **-w** flag to have mocha watch for file changes and re-run the tests (this obviates the need for watchr or similar tools).
